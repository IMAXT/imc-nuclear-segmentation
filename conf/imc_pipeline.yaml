  perform_full_analysis: True # if False, only a draft image is produced with detected cells overlaid on the reference (nuclear) channel

  adapThresh_constant: -4.9 # pixel intensity constant for background removal
  ain_automatic_image_normalization: True # automatically enhances the contrast of the input reference channel. If set to 'False', then the pipeline looks at the 'ain_image_normalization_factor' for image enhancement.
  ain_image_normalization_factor: 1 # normalization factor [1,..., 50]. A value of '1' means no change in image contrast. Larger values, increase image contrast.
